Smart video cameras are everywhereâ€”in homes for security, in cars for driving assistance, and in factories for anomaly detection. However, using video data can be challenging because it is often not searchable and may require time-consuming manual analysis.

In this workshop, you'll learn how to use [Amazon Kinesis Video Streams (Amazon KVS)](https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/video-streams/) to ingest data from your laptop camera, [Amazon Rekognition](https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/) to analyze the video, and [Amazon OpenSearch Service](https://aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/) to index the inferences. Learn how to make specific objects searchable in the recorded video and get timestamps of their occurrence.

It will take you approximately 45 minutes to complete this workshop.
